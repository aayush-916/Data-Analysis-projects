ðŸš€ Unlocking Sales Insights with Power BI & Python! ðŸ“Š

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a recent project where I used Power BI and Python (Pandas) to analyze sales data for a client. Through meticulous data cleaning, processing, and feature engineering, I created a dashboard that unveiled key insights:

- Seasonal Trends: Sales experience a significant boost in November and December, while August and September show lower figures.
- Weekly Patterns: The 2nd and 3rd weeks of the month see the highest sales, whereas the 6th week typically has the lowest.
- Top Performers: Stores 13 and 17 stand out as the top sales performers.

These findings are helping the client refine their strategies and focus on areas with the greatest impact. Excited about how data-driven insights can drive business success! #PowerBI #Python #DataAnalysis #SalesInsights
